# [五条0108] LLM时代，UX研究如何定义产品价值？
发布日期：2026/01/07

# Same, but new: 

AI agents, synthetic users, deep research, staying relevant as a UX researcher can feel like a challenge that resets every week. Teams across product, design, and engineering are moving faster than ever, often powered by the same underlying AI technologies. [Prompt engineering and system design have quickly become central topics across disciplines](https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/human-machine-responsible-ai-workflows-for-ux-research-22a5c39ac0ec), raising a familiar, and uncomfortable, question: _where does UX research fit now?_

My experience building LLM-based products over the past two years has led me to a clear conclusion. This moment is not the end of UX research. It is the same work we have always done, understanding people, defining value, but applied to a new class of systems. And for researchers willing to adapt, it creates an opportunity to move upstream and become more strategic than ever. As products become cheaper to build and AI spreads across nearly every workflow, teams now face a new foundational decision: how much AI should this feature contain?

[When the answer is “yes”, and it is not always](https://uxdesign.cc/is-your-ai-use-case-idea-really-going-to-work-7718c695e7c0), the work does not stop there. A second, equally important question follows: _what form should that AI take?_ One of the most prescient frameworks in this space comes from [Jake Saper and Jessica Cohen at Emergence Capital, who describe AI products along a spectrum](https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/your-success-with-generative-ai-may-come-down-to-these-ux-decisions). On one end are pure chat-based systems that maximize flexibility. On the other are AI-enhanced features that trade flexibility for simplicity. Most production features live closer to the latter. The product defines the prompt, sometimes with light user input, and delivers the output in a predetermined format. Every “summarize,” “rewrite,” or “generate” button we encounter today reflects this tradeoff.

Delivering value with AI enhanced features means having a solid understanding of what the user is attempting to achieve within the context of their workflow both for the actual output and the design of how it is delivered. Take for example, a summarize feature. A summary can mean many different things depending on where it is being delivered. A “Summarize” button offered in Gmail likely needs punchy and bulleted contents. The same within Adobe acrobat for a large PDF could mean a multi paragraph executive summary. It is all about context and the actual need in the moment. The same we have always been doing but new.

Adobe buttons for taking AI Actions

NotebookLM offers a compelling example of this shift. The product began as a chat-based, retrieval-augmented system. It gained widespread attention with its audio overview feature, which generated a podcast-style summary of a user’s materials, no prompting required. That feature delivered immediate, differentiated value by meeting a specific user need in a novel format. While the initial novelty has faded, subsequent updates have reinforced NotebookLM’s position as a model for AI-enhanced productivity.

The Studio feature set within NotebookLM illustrates the pattern particularly well. Users are presented with a set of structured options that guide them toward generating reports, briefs, or analyses. The real power lies not in unrestricted chat, but in the ability to lightly customize a pre-generated prompt. In Emergence Capital’s terms, this is a true copilot: a system that helps users provide the right input in order to receive a valuable output. When a user asks NotebookLM to generate a report, success is not defined by grammatical correctness or factual accuracy alone. Success is whether the output fits the user’s actual need, whether it advances their task, supports their workflow, or deepens their understanding.

This is where the role of UX research begins to change… not in kind, but in scope.

## A New Way to Create Value

Creating value with LLM-based features is not about writing the cleverest prompt. It is about defining the right instructions so the system produces something that is genuinely useful to the user in that moment. Prompt quality matters, but prompts do not exist in a vacuum. They sit at the intersection of engineering, design, and, critically, research.

NotebookLM’s opening chat response is a useful example. As a user logs in, the chat window is filled with an overview of all contents that helps users make sense of their materials as soon as they open a notebook, reducing the cognitive cost of re-orienting themselves. Engineering work was required to craft prompts that reliably surface the right insights. Design work was required to decide how that information should appear on the page. But neither of those efforts can succeed without first understanding what users actually need at the moment of entry. That understanding is where research does its most important work, informing both what the system should generate and how that output should be presented.

NotebookLM opens with a summary of the Notebooks

[Design guidance for displaying AI-generated content is relatively well covered.](https://uxdesign.cc/ai-ux-design-for-intelligent-interfaces-bc966e96107d) [Many strong frameworks already exist for structuring text, surfacing key information, and presenting outputs in ways that are readable and actionable.](https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/search?q=ai+in+product) What has received far less attention is the upstream work of shaping the instructions that guide generation in the first place. Ensuring a prompt is directionally correct — aligned to real user needs rather than abstract capabilities, was always important. With LLMs, it becomes foundational.

This is where UX research creates new leverage. By engaging early, researchers can help teams anchor feature development in what is actually possible given both the state of the technology and the user’s needs in context. In my experience, this approach consistently opens up more promising product directions. Instead of retrofitting research onto an already-defined solution, teams start with a shared understanding of value, giving design and engineering a clearer target to aim for as they build.

## A New Process for Defining Quality in Outputs

For decades, UX research has focused on identifying the user needs a product must satisfy. That part of the work is unchanged. What _is_ new is the nature of the systems we are designing. With large language models, teams no longer have complete control over outputs. These systems are inherently non-deterministic, we can guide them, but we cannot fully dictate what they will produce.

In traditional product design, many needs could be satisfied with deterministic solutions. When Apple realized people were using their iPhones as flashlights, the solution was straightforward: a single button that produced a single, predictable outcome. One tap, immediate value. No ambiguity, no interpretation required. That model works well when the need is simple and the desired outcome is clear.

As needs become more complex, so does the solution. Uber faced a different problem: passengers felt anxious while waiting for their ride. The company could not control the behavior of individual drivers, so instead it designed an experience to manage uncertainty. [A live map showed the driver’s progress (although not always truthfully)](https://www.wired.com/story/uber-algorithm-fake/?utm%5Fsource=chatgpt.com). Messaging explained potential delays. Contact options gave users a sense of agency. Each element addressed the same underlying issue, negative sentiment during the wait, even though the core system remained unpredictable.

[Working with LLMs is similar, but amplified](https://medium.com/ai-ux-designers/ai-is-breaking-free-an-emerging-ai-ux-pattern-26894a915d93). An LLM behaves less like a traditional interface and more like a human collaborator: responsive, capable, and inconsistent. It may produce insightful results one moment and confident-sounding nonsense the next. This unpredictability is not a flaw; it is a property of the technology. The challenge, then, is not eliminating variability, but maximizing output quality despite it.

That challenge requires a different approach. Rather than treating quality as an after-the-fact judgment, teams must define what “good” looks like in advance, and do so in a way that acknowledges uncertainty. This is where UX research plays a central role: translating user needs into clear quality signals that can guide generation, evaluation, and ongoing refinement, even when outputs cannot be fully controlled. Here is how I got about it.

### Surfacing Quality Signals

The first step is establishing a shared understanding of what constitutes a high-quality experience. When a user requests a briefing document in NotebookLM, what are they actually expecting to see? The answer is inherently subjective. Different users bring different expectations, shaped by their goals, context, and prior experience.

This is why qualitative research is essential. In-depth interviews allow teams to understand not just _what_ users say they want, but _how_ they judge AI-generated outputs in practice. I start by asking users to share what they expect to see as an output. Afterwards, I walk them through examples, either outputs they already use or ones I introduce, and have them describe what they mean when they say something “informs,” “summarizes,” or “provides direction.” These conversations reveal the mental models users bring to AI systems and the tradeoffs they are willing to make.

As classic Jobs to Be Done research has shown, people are rarely asking for features in the abstract, they are trying to make progress in a specific situation. The same principle applies here. With that mindset, research becomes a game of identifying the main themes in what users are asking for in the output.

In the case of NotebookLM, early qualitative work might surface themes such as trust, cognitive relief, contextual relevance, and actionability. Users may not articulate all of these dimensions explicitly, but patterns emerge across interviews. A useful heuristic here is the 80/20 rule: a relatively small set of research-derived criteria can account for the majority of users’ expectations.

For example, a high-quality briefing report in Notebook might be judged on whether it:

* Feels trustworthy
* Demonstrates understanding across multiple sources
* Reflects the user’s current context
* Connects insights to realistic next actions

### Validation and Refinement

Once core quality themes are identified, the next step is validation and refinement at scale. Surveys are particularly effective here. They allow teams to translate high-level themes into more specific, testable factors and to understand how consistently those factors matter across users and contexts. When designing these studies, I ask participants to evaluate outputs that closely resemble what the product would actually generate. Users are then asked to rate and critique those outputs, providing nuance around what makes them useful, or not.

Take trust as an example. Users frequently say they want AI outputs they can trust, but trust is not a single, universal attribute. At a minimum, it implies factual correctness. Beyond that, trust is shaped by tone, length, structure, and framing, all of which vary by context. [An email summary should be concise and direct. An executive briefing should surface key themes and unexpected insights.](https://medium.com/%40mariamargarida/designing-with-ai-ux-considerations-and-best-practices-5c6b69b92c4c) A call recap should highlight action items and mention relevant stakeholders. When an output matches what users expect in that situation, trust follows.

Surveys help teams refine these distinctions. In the NotebookLM case, researchers might explore when users feel a pre-created executive briefing demonstrates contextual awareness and when it does not. For example, users may respond positively when recent meetings or emails are incorporated appropriately, and negatively when outdated or irrelevant documents are surfaced. This level of specificity is critical, it directly informs how prompts should be written and constrained.

### Creating a Quality Rubric

With qualitative depth and survey validation in place, the next step is synthesizing insights into a shared quality rubric. There is an immediate opportunity for the engineering team to create refinement, yet as previously suggested, it is not just about the actual output but how it is designed. As such, this rubric can become the centering focus for the entire team.

A well-designed rubric defines each quality factor clearly, illustrates what good and poor outputs look like, and makes tradeoffs explicit. It allows designers, product managers, and engineers to align on what success means and how it should be evaluated. Importantly, it translates research insights into something actionable.

For prompt engineers, the rubric serves as a definition of the **global maximum**, the set of characteristics the system should optimize for overall. Prompt iteration can then focus on finding local maxima within that boundary, confident that improvements are aligned with real user needs rather than proxy metrics.

EXAMPLE: NotebookLM Summary Output Quality Rubric

### Continued Refinement

Even with a strong rubric and well-crafted prompts, the work does not end. Many teams now rely on AI-based testing and automated evaluation to refine LLM outputs over time. Companies such as [BrainTrust](https://www.braintrust.dev/) have built extensive platforms that allow product teams to test the output of their prompts at scale, across models. Leveraging these tools are far more effective when grounded in research-defined quality criteria.

Braintrust has an extensive automated evaluation system

A solid rubric ensures that synthetic user testing, automated scoring, and iterative refinement are anchored in metrics that matter to real people. Rather than optimizing loosely connected signals, teams can focus on outcomes that genuinely improve the user experience.

This ongoing refinement is especially important in a fast-moving market. User expectations are evolving quickly as the Overton window of what is possible with AI continues to shift. A bullet-point summary that felt impressive yesterday may be table stakes today, replaced by audio, visual, or personalized formats tomorrow. Quality rubrics must be revisited and updated as expectations change, creating a sustained, strategic role for UX research in keeping AI systems aligned with human value.

## UX Research as the Interpreter of Human Value

The science of UX research has not changed. People are still complex, contextual, and inconsistent, and understanding what they need remains the core of the work. The methods have not changed either. UX researchers are still experts at learning from users, identifying patterns, and translating insight into action.

What _has_ changed is the nature of the systems we are shaping. With LLM-based products, outputs are no longer guaranteed, and a new stakeholder, the prompt engineer, has entered the room. [Research now has a direct line into how AI systems are instructed, evaluated, and scaled.](https://uxdesign.cc/a-practitioners-journal-on-navigating-ux-in-the-age-of-ai-97f0a11e8319) Insights no longer stop at informing interfaces or features; they define the criteria by which machine-generated work is judged as successful.

This process is not foreign to UX research, but the leverage it creates is new. By defining quality up front, researchers can shape how intelligence itself is tuned, guiding optimization, grounding automation, and ensuring that faster iteration does not come at the expense of human value. In my own work, this shift has made the field feel more relevant and more exciting than it has in years.

Done well, UX research can become the discipline that defines what people want from AI systems, and holds those systems accountable to real outcomes. AI will continue to do more of the work. That is not changing. What can change is whether that work actually matters. UX research is uniquely positioned to make sure it does.

# [五条0108] AI流量报告：狂热退潮，谁主沉浮？
发布日期：2026/01/08

[See all posts](https://baoyu.io/translations)

2025 年最后一个季度，ChatGPT 的网站流量同比下跌了 22%。

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767828819090-c2356110-7d46-401f-9334-bce644608beb.png)

这个数字来自 Similarweb 刚刚发布的全球 AI 行业流量追踪报告（ <https://www.similarweb.com/corp/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/attachment-Global-AI-Tracker-6.pdf> ），数据截止 2026 年 1 月 2 日。作为全球流量分析的权威机构，他们的数据一直是投资者判断科技公司真实状况的重要参考。

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767828798436-e256d02a-def5-44e2-babc-8f9d17e4679a.png)

ChatGPT 流量出现两位数下滑，这是一个很大的信号。

【1】谁在涨，谁在跌

先说数据口径：这份报告追踪的是网站访问量，不包括 API 调用和第三方集成。如果你通过 Cursor、Claude Code 这类工具间接使用某个 AI 模型，这部分统计不到。但即便考虑到这个局限性，几家主要玩家的走势仍然值得细看。

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767828879550-ec30467c-ebec-4b2a-b998-54005016b5b5.png)

ChatGPT 的下滑不是突然发生的。从去年 8 月到今年 1 月，它的 12 周同比增长率一路走低：+4%、+5%、+3%，十月份开始转负，-2%、-4%、-8%，到最新的 -22%。这不是季节性波动能解释的。圣诞新年假期确实会影响流量，但其他 AI 产品并没有出现类似的大幅下跌。更重要的是，下滑趋势从秋天就开始了，假期只是加速器。

可能的解释有几个。一是竞争加剧，用户开始根据不同任务选择不同工具，不再把 ChatGPT 当作万能入口。二是“超级应用”叙事正在被解构：你可能用 Claude 写长文，用 Perplexity 搜资料，用专门的编程工具写代码，ChatGPT 不再是唯一选择。

Gemini 是这份报告里最大的赢家。49% 的同比增长，全年大部分时间都保持在两位数以上。谷歌在 AI 领域被嘲讽了一整年，说它起个大早赶个晚集，但流量数据不会说谎。谷歌的分发优势正在发挥作用：搜索、Chrome、Android。当你在 Google 搜索框里就能直接用 Gemini，很多用户就懒得再打开另一个网站了。

Claude 的数据讲述了一个“过山车”故事。从 8 月到 10 月，增长堪称惊艳：33%、46%、42%、34%、35%、47%，到 10 月底达到峰值 56%。这段时间正好是 Anthropic 密集发布新功能的窗口期，包括 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 升级、Artifacts 功能、Computer Use 等。开发者社区的口碑发酵，加上“Claude 比 GPT-4 更适合写代码”的说法广泛传播，推动了流量持续攀升。

然后画风突变。11 月中旬开始，增速从 49% 骤降到 16%，12 月稳定在 12% 左右，到 1 月直接变成 -14% 的负增长。一部分是假期效应，Claude 的用户群体以开发者和专业人士为主，年底活跃度本来就会下降。另一部分可能是新鲜感消退，那些因为好奇而尝试的用户，试用后回归了原来的工具。

但即便最新数据是 -14%，Claude 在整个 2025 年的累计表现仍然是所有主流 AI 产品中最亮眼的之一。它的用户基数比年初大了很多，-14% 是在更高基数上的回调，不是产品本身出了问题。

Manus 的故事完全不同，它展示了 AI Agent 赛道的残酷现实。年初曾经引发过一波讨论热潮，8 月初还有 25% 的同比增长。但接下来就是漫长的下滑：2%、-11%、-19%、-23%、-17%、-16%……到 11 月才勉强触底。

这条曲线非常典型。AI Agent 这个概念在 2025 年被炒得很热，几乎每家公司都在讲“Agent 是下一个大事件”。但落地到具体产品上，用户的耐心有限。如果 Agent 不能真正完成复杂任务，如果错误率让人抓狂，如果每次使用都需要大量人工干预，用户很快就会流失。

Manus 最近几个月开始回暖：-2%、-1%、1%，到最新的 12%。这可能说明团队在产品上做了改进，也可能说明 AI Agent 的整体可用性在提升。

把 Claude 和 Manus 放在一起看，能得出一个判断：在 AI 这个赛道，“模型即产品”比“Agent 即产品”更容易建立稳定的用户基础。Agent 的愿景很美好，但它对底层能力的要求更高，用户的容错空间更小。Claude 即便下滑，年流量仍然是正的；Manus 大部分时间都在负增长区间挣扎。Agent 没有未来吗？当然不是。只是那一天显然还没到。

另外几个玩家：Grok 一路狂飙，从 8 月的 9% 涨到 1 月的 52%，马斯克的 X 平台给它带来了海量曝光；Perplexity 在经历了年中的高速增长后，最新数据跌到了 -27%，可能正面临谷歌和 OpenAI 搜索功能的夹击；Meta AI 虽然最新数据只有 -3% 的小幅下滑，但十一月和十二月曾有超过 100% 的同比增长，说明 Meta 把 AI 整合进 Facebook、Instagram、WhatsApp 的策略正在见效。

【2】AI 编程工具：泡沫还是真需求

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767828925492-f56a0e99-95d5-4f08-854a-133ea643ad7d.png)

Code Completion & DevOps 这个品类的数据很有意思。整体来看，这个赛道在经历了去年的大幅下滑后，最近几个月开始企稳回升，12 周变化从 -31% 一路改善到 +9%。

具体到产品层面，分化非常明显。

Lovable 异军突起，从年初的大幅下跌（-50%）一路恢复到现在的 +23%。这是一个主打“自然语言生成应用”的工具，定位比传统代码补全更高一层：你告诉它想做什么，它帮你把整个应用搭出来。

Cursor 稳住了。这个被开发者社区追捧的 AI 编辑器，在经历了上半年的流量下滑后，最近三个月保持在 8-10% 的正增长。核心用户群似乎很稳定，说明产品确实解决了真实痛点。

Base44 是数据里最疯狂的一个，涨幅动辄几百上千个百分点。但要注意，这种爆发式增长往往是因为基数太小，不能说明太多问题。

Bolt 的表现令人担忧，持续下跌到 -39%。作为早期明星产品之一，它似乎正在被新玩家取代。Windsurf（-6%）、Tabnine（-25%）、Cognition（-22%，就是做 Devin 那家）的流量都在下滑。AI 编程工具赛道的竞争极其残酷，用户忠诚度很低，一旦有更好的替代品出现就会快速流失。

注意由于 Similarweb 主要统计的网络流量，所以这里面缺少 Claude Code 和 Codex Cli 的数据。

整体判断：AI 编程工具的需求是真实的，但具体产品的护城河很浅。这个赛道会持续洗牌，今天的明星可能就是明天的弃子。

【3】AI 写作：被通用 AI 吃掉的赛道

Writing & Content Generation 的数据很惨，整体 -10%，几乎所有玩家都在下滑。

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767828986799-e54e49cb-1780-4f3d-a818-f68b7c32ebde.png)

最惨的是 Growthbarseo，直接从 +60% 跌到 -100%，流量归零。这是一个 SEO 写作工具，显然被 ChatGPT 和其他通用 AI 彻底取代了。Jasper（-16%）、Wordtune（-16%）、Writesonic（-17%）这些曾经的明星产品，跌幅都在 15-20% 之间。Writer 从 +15% 骤跌到 -38%，Surferseo 从 +4% 跌到 -23%。

唯一的亮点是 Originality，涨了 17%。这是一个 AI 内容检测工具，专门用来识别文章是不是 AI 写的。讽刺吧？AI 写作工具在衰落，检测 AI 写作的工具反而在增长。市场对“AI 生成内容泛滥”的担忧正在转化为真实需求。

这个赛道的教训很清晰：如果你的产品只是在通用 AI 外面包了一层壳，加了几个模板，迟早会被干掉。用户会直接去用 ChatGPT 或 Claude，没必要多绕一道。AI 写作工具的崩溃是所有“AI 套壳”产品的前车之鉴。

【4】AI 绘图：曾经的顶流正在退烧

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767829008984-57566539-6bb3-425b-b808-c63f84a4944f.png)

Design & Image Generation 这个赛道的整体数据是 -10%，这可能是最让人意外的。要知道，两年前 AI 绘图几乎是生成式 AI 的代名词，Midjourney 的 Discord 服务器一度是全球最活跃的社区之一。

现在呢？Midjourney 从 8 月的 +33% 一路跌到 -16%。Leonardo（+2%）勉强持平，Deepai（-33%）、Ideogram（-22%）大幅下滑。整个赛道在过去六个月没有一个月是正增长的。

AI 绘图的“玩具期”可能已经过去了。那些因为好奇而尝试的用户已经离开，剩下的是真正有创作需求的人群，而这个群体的规模比想象中小。另一个因素是，通用 AI 工具（ChatGPT、Claude）现在都内置了图像生成能力，用户不需要再专门去访问 Midjourney 的网站。

不过有一个异类：Skylum 涨了 67%。这是一个专注于照片后期处理的 AI 工具，定位比“从零生成图片”更实用。这暗示了一个方向：AI 图像工具的未来可能不是“生成”，而是“增强”。帮你把照片修得更好看，比凭空生成一张图更有持续价值。

要注意的是，nano banana pro 其实带来了很大一波流量，这波流量应该被 Similarweb 算在 Gemini 里面了。

【5】AI 视频：稳定但分化剧烈

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767829072510-1778ccbf-f10e-4f46-9bd0-94c94e55abb2.png)

Video Generation 整体增长 5%，看起来还算健康，但内部分化非常剧烈。

快手旗下的可灵（Klingai）是最大赢家，+36%。这个工具在国内和海外都获得了不错的口碑，尤其是在生成连贯动作视频方面。Typecast 涨了 53%，它专注于 AI 虚拟人播报，找到了一个相对垂直的场景。HeyGen（+8%）和 Synthesia（+13%）也保持了正增长，它们都聚焦在“数字人 + 视频”这个企业级应用场景。

但 Runway，这个一度被视为 AI 视频标杆的产品，跌了 32%。Captions 跌了 37%，Descript 跌了 10%。

一个明显的现象：那些定位“通用视频生成”的工具普遍表现不佳，而聚焦特定场景（数字人、虚拟主播、特效素材）的工具反而活得不错。视频生成可能还没到“一个工具打天下”的阶段，垂直场景的机会更大。

【6】其他值得关注的信号

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767829105491-59b17887-ea92-4c2c-ba8f-2ed42bfc6056.png)

音乐生成是所有 AI 细分领域里增速最快的，整体涨了 30%。Suno 一骑绝尘（+46%），几乎占据了这个赛道的半壁江山。输入几句话就能生成完整的歌曲，包括人声、编曲、混音，质量已经到了“能听”的程度。当然，版权问题是悬在头上的达摩克利斯之剑，Suno 和 Udio 都面临诉讼。

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767829094809-3453d8d5-be93-477d-adbf-30a00405bcbd.png)

语音 AI 也在回暖，整体涨了 14%。ElevenLabs 继续领跑（+27%），语音克隆质量确实甩开竞争对手一大截，而且在播客、有声书、游戏配音等领域找到了真实的付费场景。

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767829120961-6dac05d5-fba2-48da-8776-03b2283eb7c4.png)

自动化工具集体下滑，n8n（-27%）、Zapier（-24%）、Make（-11%）都出现了两位数下跌。一个可能的解释是：通用 AI 正在吞噬一部分简单自动化的需求。以前你需要用 Zapier 连接各种服务，现在直接让 AI 写段代码就搞定了。

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767829140072-79013626-9bad-440d-975f-d1b430a09db6.png)

AI 旅行规划雷声大雨点小，整体 -4%。Mindtrip 从 +153% 暴跌到 -6%，这个赛道曾经被寄予厚望，但旅行是低频决策，而且 Google、携程这些巨头都在往自己产品里塞 AI 功能，独立的 AI 旅行应用很难活下来。

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767829446886-924cd19e-8e15-4232-b144-9b4c57c9a43c.png)

Browser（浏览器自动化）整体暴跌22%，Browserbase从+58%跌到-41%——AI Agent的"基础设施"概念很性感，但离真正被用起来还有很长的路，这个赛道目前更多是开发者在试验，普通用户根本不知道它存在。

【7】那些“被 AI 颠覆”的行业

报告的后半部分追踪了几个被认为会被 AI 冲击的传统行业，结论可能和你想的不太一样。

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767829191850-cd3713a4-4267-4dc7-8117-b2e402442574.png)

传统搜索（谷歌、必应等）整体稳定在 -3% 左右，没有崩盘迹象。谷歌几乎纹丝不动（-1% 到 -2%）。必应反而跌得更厉害（-12%），讽刺的是这正是微软整合 AI 最激进的产品。

![](https://baoyu.io/uploads/2026-01-08-1767829246504-3a5496d5-2c11-44c7-b164-43dc786a7b7c.png)

数字自由职业平台（Fiverr、Upwork）从年中的 -6% 到 -9% 一路改善到 0%。这出乎很多人预料，大家以为 AI 会让自由职业者失业，但至少从流量看，这些平台的用户并没有大规模流失。

在线教育（Udemy、Coursera、Duolingo）整体从 -8% 改善到 +2%。传统教育平台展现出比预期更强的韧性。

Web & Shop Builders（建站工具）Squarespace（+19%）和Square（+17%）逆势增长，Wix、Shopify、Woocommerce集体下滑，AI建站工具（Lovable、Bolt）正在分流那些"只想快速搭个网站"的用户，但需要品牌调性和深度定制的高端需求反而更稳。

Discussion & Q&A Forums（讨论论坛）Reddit一枝独秀（+12%），Quora跌掉一半（-53%），当AI能直接回答问题，谁还去翻别人的旧帖子？

这些数据给出一个提醒：AI 对传统行业的冲击是真实的，但速度比媒体渲染的要慢得多。“颠覆”是一个漫长的过程，不是一夜之间发生的事。

【8】几条规律

把所有赛道放在一起看，有几个规律浮现出来：

第一，“工具化”的 AI 应用比“玩具化”的 AI 应用更有生命力。语音、音乐这类解决真实生产力问题的工具在增长，而绘图、旅行规划这类满足一时好奇的应用在衰退。

第二，垂直场景比通用场景更容易建立壁垒。AI 视频里活得好的是数字人工具，AI 图像里活得好的是照片增强工具，而不是“什么都能做”的通用生成器。

第三，所有“包装层”产品都面临被通用 AI 吞噬的风险。AI 写作工具的崩溃是前车之鉴，自动化工具可能是下一个。

第四，“模型即产品”比“Agent 即产品”更稳。Claude 即便下滑，全年仍然是正增长；Manus 大部分时间都在负增长区间挣扎。Agent 的愿景很美好，但那一天还没到。

【9】最后

这份报告的核心信息其实很简单：AI 行业正在从“所有船只都上涨”的早期狂热，进入“各凭本事”的残酷竞争阶段。

ChatGPT 的流量下滑不意味着 AI 见顶，而是意味着市场正在分化。用户变得更挑剔，开始为不同任务选择不同工具。赢者通吃的格局没有形成，反而是群雄并起的局面。

对普通用户来说，这是好消息，竞争意味着更多选择、更低价格、更快迭代。

对从业者和投资者来说，这份报告的价值在于提供了一个相对客观的视角，让我们不至于被社交媒体上的狂热或悲观情绪带偏。

流量不是一切，但流量不会撒谎。

# [五条0108] Gemini CLI 新增 Agent Skills，AI 也能学专业技能了！
发布日期：2026/01/08

Note:  
Gemini CLI 更新预览版支持 Agent Skills  

_Note: This is an experimental feature enabled via `experimental.skills`. You can also search for “Skills” within the `/settings` interactive UI to toggle this and manage other skill-related settings._

Agent Skills allow you to extend Gemini CLI with specialized expertise, procedural workflows, and task-specific resources. Based on the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, a “skill” is a self-contained directory that packages instructions and assets into a discoverable capability.

Unlike general context files ([GEMINI.md](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/gemini-md)), which provide persistent project-wide background, Skills represent **on-demand expertise**. This allows Gemini to maintain a vast library of specialized capabilities—such as security auditing, cloud deployments, or codebase migrations—without cluttering the model’s immediate context window.

Gemini autonomously decides when to employ a skill based on your request and the skill’s description. When a relevant skill is identified, the model “pulls in” the full instructions and resources required to complete the task using the tool.`activate_skill`

* **Shared Expertise:** Package complex workflows (like a specific team’s PR review process) into a folder that anyone can use.
* **Repeatable Workflows:** Ensure complex multi-step tasks are performed consistently by providing a procedural framework.
* **Resource Bundling:** Include scripts, templates, or example data alongside instructions so the agent has everything it needs.
* **Progressive Disclosure:** Only skill metadata (name and description) is loaded initially. Detailed instructions and resources are only disclosed when the model explicitly activates the skill, saving context tokens.

Gemini CLI discovers skills from three primary locations:

1. **Project Skills** (): Project-specific skills that are typically committed to version control and shared with the team.`.gemini/skills/`
2. **User Skills** (): Personal skills available across all your projects.`~/.gemini/skills/`
3. **Extension Skills**: Skills bundled within installed [extensions](https://geminicli.com/docs/extensions).

**Precedence:** If multiple skills share the same name, higher-precedence locations override lower ones: **Project > User > Extension**.

Use the slash command to view and manage available expertise:`/skills`

* `/skills list` (default): Shows all discovered skills and their status.
* `/skills disable <name>`: Prevents a specific skill from being used.
* `/skills enable <name>`: Re-enables a disabled skill.
* `/skills reload`: Refreshes the list of discovered skills from all tiers.

_Note: `/skills disable` and `/skills enable` default to the `user` scope. Use `--scope project` to manage project-specific settings._

The command provides management utilities:`gemini skills`

Terminal window

```
# Enable/disable skills. Can use --scope to specify project or usergemini skills enable my-expertisegemini skills disable my-expertise
```

A skill is a directory containing a file at its root. This file uses YAML frontmatter for metadata and Markdown for instructions.`SKILL.md`

```
description: <what the skill does and when Gemini should use it><your instructions for how the agent should behave / use the skill>
```

* **`name`**: A unique identifier (lowercase, alphanumeric, and dashes).
* **`description`**: The most critical field. Gemini uses this to decide when the skill is relevant. Be specific about the expertise provided.
* **Body**: Everything below the second is injected as expert procedural guidance for the model.`---`

```
user asks for "feedback," a "review," or to "check" their changes.1.  **Analyze**: Review the staged changes or specific files provided. Ensure3.  **Security**: Flag any potential security vulnerabilities.4.  **Tests**: Verify that new logic has corresponding test coverage and that
```

While you can structure your skill directory however you like, the Agent Skills standard encourages these conventions:

* **`scripts/`**: Executable scripts (bash, python, node) the agent can run.
* **`references/`**: Static documentation, schemas, or example data for the agent to consult.
* **`assets/`**: Code templates, boilerplate, or binary resources.

When a skill is activated, Gemini CLI provides the model with a tree view of the entire skill directory, allowing it to discover and utilize these assets.

1. **Discovery**: At the start of a session, Gemini CLI scans the discovery tiers and injects the name and description of all enabled skills into the system prompt.
2. **Activation**: When Gemini identifies a task matching a skill’s description, it calls the tool.`activate_skill`
3. **Consent**: You will see a confirmation prompt in the UI detailing the skill’s name, purpose, and the directory path it will gain access to.
4. **Injection**: Upon your approval:  
   * The body and folder structure is added to the conversation history.`SKILL.md`  
   * The skill’s directory is added to the agent’s allowed file paths, granting it permission to read any bundled assets.
5. **Execution**: The model proceeds with the specialized expertise active. It is instructed to prioritize the skill’s procedural guidance within reason.

# [五条0108] Claude Code 2.1.1 更新，开发工作流大升级！
发布日期：2026/01/08

Claude Code 迭代很快，已经到了 2.1.1 版本，这次有一堆更新，三个值得关注的更新：

1）技能热重载终于来了。改完 skills 文件夹里的东西立刻生效，不用重启 session

2）新增 context: fork 选项，技能和斜杠命令可以在独立子智能体里跑，不污染主对话上下文。那些需要大量中间步骤但你不想看全过程的任务，现在干净多了

3）子智能体（Task 工具）被拒绝权限后不再直接躺平，会自己尝试其他方案继续干活。这让 agentic 工作流更有韧性，不会因为一个权限卡住整个流程
