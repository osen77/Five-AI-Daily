# [五条1209] 从模糊到精准：让AI读懂你的设计语言
发布日期：2025/12/05

 Summary: Create better AI-prototyping designs by using precise visual keywords, references, analysis, as well as mock data and code snippets.

The rise of GenAI tools has introduced a new paradigm for design work — rather than crafting interfaces by [directly manipulating](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/direct-manipulation/) elements in design tools, designers can prompt AI-prototyping tools to generate designs.

When you’re working with AI, the output quality will be largely dependent on the specificity of the prompt. This article discusses common issues with vague text prompts and offers recommendations on how to achieve better results from AI-prototyping tools without undertaking the bulk of the design work yourself.

## Research Recap

When we [asked AI-prototyping tools to generate a live-training profile page for NN/G course attendees](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-prototyping/), a detailed prompt yielded quality results resembling what a human designer created, whereas a vague prompt generated inconsistent and unpredictable outcomes across the board. (For more information about the prompts and tools we used, [see our description of the study methodology](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/testing-ai-methodology/).)

A skilled human designer can take a broad design statement (such as “design a profile page that allows course attendees to do XYZ”), identify and prioritize the information users need to see on the page, choose the design patterns that support users in accomplishing their goals, and arrange elements in a logical layout that is easy to navigate. In contrast, AI struggles with ambiguity and is unable to deliver thoughtful results within a broad context.

While open-ended prompts may be fine for exploring diverse ideas in the early design phase, they fail to produce the precise outputs needed for all other design work.

However, writing long, detailed text prompts is rarely the default strategy in practice because **providing comprehensive detail takes time** and many **turn to AI precisely to reduce work.** To get the most value from AI prototyping tools, designers need to understand how prompt specificity affects the AI’s output and tailor their prompting strategy to fit the task.

## Problems with Generic Prompts in Design Work

One of the most prominent patterns we saw across prototypes generated with broad prompts is the **Frankenstein layout** — designs that feel **randomly pieced together** instead of thoughtfully structured.

AI-prototyping tools demonstrate a surface-level understanding of individual UI components (e.g., [progress bars](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/), [list view](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/card-view-vs-list-view/)s). But when these elements are combined to create a page, the layouts often lack hierarchy, displaying a few common characteristics:

* Unnecessary visual clutter
* Repeated design elements
* Counterintuitive content flow
* Visually prominent containers with low information density

### Unnecessary Visual Clutter

AI prototyping tools often **generate more elements than necessary in response to broadly scoped prompts.** It’s like an inefficient navigation system that _can_ get you to the destination but always takes a convoluted route.

Cluttered designs hurt everyone: users’ [cognitive load](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/) and [interaction cost](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interaction-cost-definition/) increase, important content risks being buried, and the system becomes more cumbersome, resulting in slower load times and more complex code for developers to manage.

### Repeated Design Elements

In our testing, there were several instances where **the same element or information was displayed multiple times.** In contrast, in a real design, screen real estate is precious and user attention is scarce, so design teams rarely tolerate this redundancy. Repetition without purpose only [adds noise](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/signal-noise-ratio/) to the interface and distracts users from the key content.

In both interfaces generated by AI (Lovable & Bolt), the certification progress bars are duplicated within the same interface. While the certification process is presented in a slightly different way, the information is redundant.

### Counterintuitive Content Flow

Users expect information to follow a logical, intuitive sequence — typically moving from general to specific, with related items grouped together. This structure helps users build [mental models](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/) and reduces the effort needed to parse through and understand content, and reduces the effort needed to parse through and understand content.

Multiple **AI-generated designs presented content in an illogical sequence.** These disruptions, compounded by poor visual hierarchy, created disjointed layouts with no clear focus or sense of progression.

Annotated dashboard layout showing a linear sequence of learning sections interrupted by a user-profile widget placed mid-page, highlighting a break in hierarchy and flow.

### Visually Prominent Containers with Low Information Density

[Visual hierarchy](https://www.nngroup.com/search/?q=visual+hierarchy) guides users to the most important elements on the page. The larger, more colorful, or more prominent an element, the greater its perceived importance relative to other items.

When **hierarchy contradicts content priority,** users may feel confused or distracted from completing the main tasks. This is a common flaw of AI-generated interfaces, which often place visual emphasis on the wrong element, as the model doesn’t have a contextual understanding of what is essential for the goal.

Dashboard layout where a large certification-progress ring dominates the page, visually outweighing course information despite its lower priority.

Another pattern that we noticed in the AI-generated designs was **the unnecessary use of prominent containers displaying a single piece of numerical information.** These containers tended to occupy a large amount of space but communicated little information; moreover, this information was secondary to the main user task.

## 5 Prompting Strategies for AI Prototyping

In this section, we discuss 5 ways of improving the output of a vague text prompt without needing to design in Figma first or write extensive prompts. These strategies can be combined or used separately to **increase your input specificity.**

### Use Precise Visual Keywords

When crafting prompts**, clarity and specificity** matter more than sheer length. Many frontier AI models like ChatGPT5 are designed to follow instructions with laser focus. _**Verbosity without precision**_**hurts clarity** _—_ a concise, well-chosen keyword can often produce better results than a long but vague description.

When using AI-assisted design or coding tools, describe your intent by pointing to established design styles or frameworks instead of using generic visual descriptions like _simple_, _clean_, and _modern_. Referencing a recognizable visual design style — like _[skeuomorphism](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/skeuomorphism/), [flat design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design/), [glassmorphism](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/glassmorphism/),_ or _retro / Y2K_ — helps the model interpret your visual intent. This is where a good understanding of design vocabulary and of [visual-design fundamentals](https://www.nngroup.com/courses/visual-design/) becomes essential.

For example _(_assuming [_neobrutalism_](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/neobrutalism/) is the target visual style_)_:

* **❌** **Poor:** “Design a trendy conference landing page.”
* **✅** **Acceptable:** “Design a conference landing page with high contrast, blocky layouts, and bold colors.”
* **👏** **Better:** “Design a conference landing page in a _neobrutalist_ style.”

![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/12/01/neobrutalism.jpg)

Explicitly naming the neobrutalist style in the prompt produced the best result.

The same principle applies when prompting AI for code generation. Developers often include **specific frameworks and component libraries** (e.g., _React_, _Next.js_, or _Tailwind CSS_) early in their prompts to shape the structure and logic of the generated code.

Designers can also reference a famous design system or brand style by its name. That said, avoid asking AI to imitate a specific brand. While it’s tempting to request “design like Apple” or “in Airbnb’s style,” copying an existing brand’s visual identity is not a sustainable strategy. **Famous brands don’t guarantee good design.** A design that works for a billion-dollar company might fail in your context due to different goals, audiences, or constraints.

### Attach Lightweight Visual References

High-fidelity mockups are effective for communicating your design vision to AI-prototyping tools, but they take time to create — often more than writing a detailed prompt. When you’re still early in the design process or lack the resources to produce polished assets, use **lightweight visual references** instead, such [moodboards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mood-boards/), inspiration images, or screenshots of your [design system](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-systems-101/).

![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/11/16/8-moodboard.jpg)

When a screenshot of a Pinterest board was provided alongside a broad text prompt (Prompt 1), Figma Make generated a design that visually resembled the board’s design style.

Do manage your expectations with this approach. Even though image references are a big step up from text-based descriptions, it’s unlikely for AI to achieve pixel-perfect precision.

![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/11/16/9-ds.jpg)

When given a screenshot of the Material Design 3 system, Figma Make produced a design with a similar tone, but with more saturated colors than the reference.

When visual precision is essential, connect AI tools directly to your design source. Some tools have built-in features that can retrieve the visual spec and design tokens directly from a Figma frame. Developers can also leverage [Figma MCP](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Figma-MCP-server) to pull in design details like design frames, variables, components, and layout data directly into their IDEs. These methods will achieve higher precision than image uploads.

Finally, **don’t confuse visual fidelity with design quality.** A visually polished AI-generated mockup that aligns with your design system can still be a poor design if the accompanying prompt is vague or underspecified. Evaluate the outcome for usability and clarity — not just for visual polish.

Annotated dashboard generated with a Material Design–style kit, highlighting issues such as an overly long stacked layout, an oversized progress bar, wide gaps separating related course details, and a hard-to-read label.

### Conduct a Visual Analysis with AI to Formulate the Prompt

While most AI-prototyping tools support image uploads in addition to text prompting, not all do — and some limit image uploads to paid plans. An alternative is to **use a general-purpose chatbot to analyze the visual style or layout of a page in natural language**, then convert that description into a design prompt. This text-based approach can also be combined with an image attachment to further reinforce the intended visual direction.

![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/12/01/screenshot-2025-11-27-at-25501pm.jpg)

_In this example,_ [NNG’s Live Training overview page](https://www.nngroup.com/training/live-courses/) _served as the visual reference for generating the_ Course Profile _page. When prompted to conduct a visual analysis, ChatGPT produced a detailed list of design characteristics and stylistic elements. These AI-generated descriptions can then be refined into prompts or used to extract relevant keywords and phrases for new ones._

![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/11/16/12-design.jpg)

The visual description serves as supplemental design context alongside the generic text prompt (Prompt 1). Using this approach, the generated design reproduces the visual style of the

### Generate Mock Data

Crafting prompts for AI-prototyping tools is a lot like creating [design specs](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/creating-design-specs-for-development/) for handoffs. In both cases, designers need to define not only visual and layout details but also interaction flows, content, and accessibility.

We often recommend [a _content-focused_ design approach](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/content-frames/) — that is, **working with realistic data so that visual design supports the key content** rather than the other way around. The same principle applies when using AI-prototyping tools: providing sample content or data guides the AI to generate better designs.

Designers should collaborate with developers and content teams to obtain the data displayed in the interface. When real data isn’t available early in the process, designers can use AI [to generate mock data first](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-data-prototype-testing/), then refine the content and iterate on the design based on that data.

![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/11/16/13-mockdata.jpg)

ChatGPT generated the mock data in JSON format, which was then used as content in Figma Make to create the profile page. Information is better grouped and displayed with this approach.

### Attach Code Snippets

When AI interprets images or documents instead of receiving direct input, some contextual details can get lost in translation. Therefore, the more direct the context you provide, the less interpretation the system needs to make — and the higher the accuracy of the output. One of the most direct forms of context you can provide to an AI-prototyping tool is code snippets.

Designers can source code snippets in several ways:

* **From your codebase:** Collaborate with developers to access relevant components or layout structures.
* **From open-source design systems or code repositories:** Many public design systems (e.g., Material Design, Carbon) and platforms like [21st.dev](https://21st.dev/community/components) or GitHub offer reusable component code that can be incorporated directly into prompts.
* **From live websites:** Use browser-inspection tools or plugins to extract the underlying code of a page or component.

When using external sources, **keep in mind that visible code isn’t always free to reuse** — always check the licensing or permissions. Stick to code from your own product, shared design-system libraries, or open-source components.

![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/11/16/14-code_1.jpg)

The course-listing table is generated by referencing the Table component from the Shopify Polaris design system and attaching the corresponding code snippets.

While this method yields the most precise results in AI-prototyping tools, it comes with tradeoffs. Long code snippets can overload the model’s context window, leading to performance issues. Moreover, this approach requires designers to understand basic code structure and assess the quality of the snippet before using it.

## Iterate and Critique Your Prompt with AI

Besides prompting AI to generate designs, you can also use it as a creative partner to enhance your prompts. You can use a general-purpose chatbot to:

* **Create a text prompt** from scratch, based on provided context
* **Organize design requirements** into a clear, structured prompt
* **Ask guiding questions** that help you think through requirements and refine ideas
* **Critique existing prompts,** identify missing context, and suggest improvements
* **Brainstorm and ideate** design variations in text form
* **Generate code snippets** for design components

## Good Design Decisions Can’t be Automated

At the end of the day, there is no shortcut to solving complex design problems. While strategies discussed in this article can help you improve your prompt specificity and get higher-quality output, **they can’t replace the hard work that goes into thinking through design requirements, weighing tradeoffs, and making informed design decisions**.

Over the past few months, I have noticed a quiet shift in how we build products. You start noticing design and engineering overlapping at scale much earlier, pretty much as soon as a feature moves from research into the ideation stage.

I built this AI-powered prototype for a feature with Claude Code

This is one of the recent features where I built the entire flow end-to-end with a different workflow. I designed the experience, developed the UI with ShadCN components, built the interaction patterns, and connected it to real logic in the background. The prototype pulled data through Supabase MCP calls and interacted with OpenAI APIs to generate adaptive UI components, so the whole thing behaved close to the final product experience rather than a typical mock or demo.

This shift in how I solve problems pushed me beyond prototyping. I started productionizing my work inside the codebase, learning engineering patterns every day, and developing a clearer sense of how the product should function from end to end across the entire system.

> It moved me from being a designer to becoming a maker, and it is now shaping me into a **context-aware builder**.

This article is a reflection of that journey, how it improved the velocity, the challenges I encountered, and what we should anticipate, that could define the next chapter of product design development.

## The Problem I Kept Running Into

When the [vibe coding culture](https://spin.atomicobject.com/designers-vibe-coding/) started appearing everywhere, I saw significant people from the design community building retro games, dashboards, weather widgets, note apps, and many experiments powered by AI-generated code. It was encouraging to see designers making ideas work, but it reminded me of the famous [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) phase where everything looked beautiful but very little made it into real products.

I kept asking myself:

> Is this just another playground? Or can this way of working eventually influence production software?

The understanding of what sits under the hood among the community was still early, and most prototypes focused more on exploration than real functionality. It felt like the community is just beginning to scratch the surface of what is possible.

The bigger issue was not the experiments themselves. It was that designers still did not have a functional layer to work in. This gap between design and development has been [well-documented](https://webdesignerdepot.com/the-designer-developer-handoff-is-still-broken-why/), with many teams struggling to move from static mockups to functional products. Figma, the most common tool designers use, sits in an isolated space. Even with custom plugins, Code Connect, and dev mode, the influence on the codebase is minimal. Most of it feels like a workaround. The design mocks rarely have the ability to test with real or dynamic data.

The other challenge is **feature fragmentation**.

Figma project view showing a grid of separate design files, illustrating how individual features are organized into their own design files.

In Figma, each feature is usually worked on in a separate file. It gives clarity for design, but it does not reflect how a real product works. In an actual product, features live together, share context, depend on each other, and behave as a single system. Moving across flows should feel natural and connected, not scattered across isolated files.

If you look at the distribution, the user interacts with the final product. Testers have staging and UAT environments. Developers have a full git workflow with branches and review layers. **Designers do not have anything equivalent.** There is no layer that lets us build with a real functional context.

## Where I Started: Two Paths

My initial integration of AI into my workflow was actually quite practical. I was trying to optimize some design operations and design system workflows, and I did not have enough bandwidth to fit all of it into my routine. There was no AI integration inside IDEs at that time. Everything was manual, disconnected, and very experimental. So used AI generated scripts for these automations.

Seeing the potential, I wanted to understand the full range of AI API offerings beyond prompt-based code generation. During the same timeline, I was exploring prototyping with Origami and wanted to see if I could bring AI capability directly into the prototype. I experimented with building an Origami prototype that used the OpenAI API for chat completion requests and audio-to-text conversion

This exploration revealed two paths:

1. **Using AI to build the prototype itself**
2. **Enabling the prototype with AI features**

This distinction between using AI as a tool to build versus integrating AI into features aligns with what [Wyatt Kay describes](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/vibe-coding-as-a-designer-what-ive-learned-so-far-029c1cc4636d) as the dual nature of AI-powered design work where the technology serves both as creation medium and feature component. Understanding this separation became an important part of how I now approach prototyping ideas.

## Finding the Right Tools

As I started building more rigorously, I needed to settle on tools that matched my workflow. I explored several options including [v0](https://v0.app/) for quick layouts and [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) for its smooth IDE experience, but token exhaustion rate became a practical constraint.

[Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) stood out for its efficiency. Using the same Sonnet model across different tools, Claude Code handled tokens far better and stayed lightweight for repeated everyday use. It began as a simple terminal interface but quickly became my primary tool because it fit the way I build products every day.

The rise of MCPs (Model Context Protocol) also meant that most missing features could be achieved across different AI-powered IDEs anyway. What mattered more was finding a tool that matched my cost and workflow needs for sustained use.

## Where I Arrived: The Shadow Repo Approach

I came across a [tweet](https://x.com/nayakkayak/status/1958677324863328643?s=20) by Aatish Nayak, VP product at Harvey, about building an entire frontend using vibe coding. He called it a **shadow repo**, and the idea made immediate sense. The concept addresses what [Dan Mall and Brad Frost call the ‘Hot Potato Process’](https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/articles/design-handoff/), rapid iteration between designers and developers that eliminates traditional handoff friction.

Think of it like this: if staging/UAT is where testers validate features, a shadow repo is where designers validate functionality. This approach creates breathing room to experiment with full product context and less risk.

A real git branch carries engineering expectations, reviews, and risk. A shadow repo removes that pressure. You can try ideas, break things, and test with real or mock data without touching the product codebase.

Here is how I shaped workflow with this shadow repo:

* Build a repo that mirrors the real app structure
* Follow production component patterns
* Use Figma for skeleton and visual direction
* Translate with Figma MCP, applying coded design system rules
* Refine through manual edits and prompting
* Use Notion MCP for handoff review notes
* Port to production with developer review and proper API wiring

Flow diagram showing how design and code inputs feed into a shadow repository. A “Design File” flows into the shadow repo through Figma MCP, and a “Component Library” flows in through ShadCN MCP. Both inputs merge into the “Shadow Repo Codebase,” which then connects to Notion MCP, producing a final “Handoff Spec” for developer review.

## Solving the Data Problem

Early shadow repo prototypes relied on local storage, placeholder JSONs, and fake values. This breaks down when replicating a full product experience.

I created a shadow backend using Supabase. Supabase’s free tier plus [Supabase MCP tools ](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp)were perfect for this: quick tables, simple edge functions, instant data edits, predictable structure. This made the shadow repo feel complete.

Flow diagram showing how three inputs feed into a shadow repo workflow. A “Design File” flows into the system through Figma MCP, a “Data Layer” flows in through Supabase MCP, and a “Component Library” flows in through ShadCN MCP. All three converge into the “Shadow Repo Codebase,” which then connects to Notion MCP to generate the final “Handoff Spec.”

Why not use the actual API of the product?

* Unmoderated calls are expensive
* Prototypes trigger unpredictable requests
* And I did not want to risk touching production backend systems at this point.

Once the data layer was in place, I could explore the second path: enabling prototypes with AI features themselves.

At Dynamo AI, our tools rely heavily on AI systems. My prototypes needed to behave like AI-powered products. I integrated lightweight OpenAI API calls to replicate real-world feature responses.

Supabase made this efficient. I could store conversation history, manage state, and handle AI responses without complex backend logic. MCP tools connected everything seamlessly for defining actual API calls, response processing, and dynamic interface updates.

And for inspecting within the browser by the agent during active development, the [Chrome Dev Tools MCP](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp) solves it with my Claude setup.

## What I Gained from Building Functionally

This approach doesn’t require designers to become full engineers, a [decades-old debate](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/designers-coding) that often misses the point. As [Cap Watkins argues](https://capwatkins.com/blog/why-designers-really-should-learn-to-code), learning to code isn’t about independence but about deepening collaboration and shared understanding.

With this setup, I was able to prototype working features and ship much faster. In one instance, the developers reviewed the prototype code and had the production version ready for testing in a single evening. That was the moment I realized this workflow is quite practical, scalable and increase the velocity to a greater extent. I was no longer handing off design files. I was handing off a working prototype with a higher probability of accurately representing the idea into production quickly.

Animated neon illustration of two outlined human heads facing each other, with glowing brains connected by looping, pulsating energy bands.

These are some of the shifts I noticed in my approach:

**Better fine-tuning of UI component architecture:** Seeing components run with real variants, props, and constraints helped me refine the architecture upfront and create cleaner, more scalable patterns.

**Handling Edge Cases Early:** AI made it easier to surface edge cases and logical gaps early, long before engineering touched them.

**Thinking Through the Data Layer:** Working with real-like data broadened my thinking on structuring payloads and designing interface for efficient API usage and holistic thinking of how data flows through the entire system functionally.

**Enabling AI Features to Augment Capabilities:** Integrating actual AI behavior into prototypes changed how I think about product features. Instead of designing around static functionality, I started considering how AI could augment existing capabilities.

## How This Changed My Role in Problem Solving

This entire experiment changed my perspective on what it means to be a designer.

When you understand how data flows, how components are structured, what triggers API calls, and what engineers worry about, your design decisions become grounded in reality.

> You stop thinking like someone who “hands off” and start thinking like someone who builds.

Animated gif of minimalist illustration of an open hand holding a simple outlined 3D house shape resting on a flat platform

AI coding tools are powerful, but they also come with real headaches:

**The rabbit-hole edits:** AI produces the first version well, but small edits sometimes break the entire flow and get you into an unnecessary loop of issues.

**Pattern-level mistakes:** With React components, I have faced unnecessary hooks, redundant functions, nested components, strange abstractions, and recursive API calls.

**AI fingerprints:** AI often generates the same UI patterns for the same problem and ignores existing components.

**Overbuilding:** It is easy to drift into solving engineering problems and lose sight of the actual user problem.

However, these challenges eventually can be addressed by defining rules that you can mention in your AI tool. In Claude, this is supported by [Claude.md](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) and [Claude Skills](https://www.claude.com/blog/skills), which are project-agnostic and allow you to define explicit conditions and rules that guide how the AI should approach your programming tasks.

## What This Means Going Forward

The way we build products is shifting steadily. AI coding tools are changing the relationship between design and engineering. Shadow repos and vibe-coded prototypes let designers get much closer to reality. Complexity becomes easier to reason about. Ideas get validated faster.

> Teams spend less time interpreting and more time building.

We are moving from designer to maker to builder through changes in capability.

This mirrors what [Jakob Nielsen describes as ‘vibe design’](https://www.uxtigers.com/post/vibe-coding-vibe-design), where AI enables rapid prototyping and designers work more iteratively with functional interfaces rather than static deliverables.

The shadow repo approach might not be a permanent solution. It is a good transitional framework that works while the industry figures out what the next generation of product-building tools should be. Right now, this framework works well for our team to build functionally without the constraints of traditional tools or the risks of production systems.

The industry is figuring this out together. If you are exploring similar territory or approaching these problems differently, let’s connect and learn from each other.

# [五条1219] AI 产品的“记忆”设计：一个三层框架
发布日期：2025/12/18

## A UX framework for managing library, conversation, and memory in LLM interfaces

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*AC5KhEsCkrjnz5-MEBMlJg.png)

AI context as a reflection of human memory

To make a large language model (LLM) truly useful, everything begins with context management.

Context is more than a single prompt, it is the entire accumulation of conversation series. Every user input, combined with every AI response, forms the evolving environment in which meaning is created.

In practice, context behaves a lot like memory. Just as human memory is organized, the context of an AI system can also be understood as a layered structure.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*cQUs2btriDxwtPehCYn4IA.png)

Human memory is often described in three parts:

* **Semantic memory:** long-term knowledge, concepts, and facts — what I know.
* **Working memory:** temporary information needed for the current task — what I am processing right now.
* **Long-term memory:** accumulated experiences, preferences, and patterns — what I tend to do.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*ALnkFzPxHwronO5qI9zCNg.png)

AI systems mirror this architecture and its context can also be divided into three layers:

* **Library:** user-provided materials such as files, webpages, and excerpts.
* **Conversation:** the active dialogue, grounded in the current topic.
* **Memory:** accumulated information across sessions, specific to the same user.

Each layer plays a different role, and each demands a different design strategy.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*meoUHzI7OxjJIiXnH7zHAQ.png)

> Establish a reliable knowledge base by enabling users to curate and structure their own materials. These resources serve as the system’s fixed semantic assets, grounding the model’s understanding in specific, user-defined contexts.

The value of this layer lies not in storage, but in how external knowledge is constructed and invoked.

Users need explicit, controllable access to these sources. Information must be **_readable_** to the model, **_discoverable_** to the user, and **_transparent_** in its invocation.

### Key Feature

* **Multimodal parser:** Accepts documents, web links, cloud files, and videos. Automatically converts them into structured, indexable content with keywords and metadata.
* **Context invoker:** Allows users to choose specific sources during a conversation. Context appears as visible chips, making the invocation scope clear and controllable.

### Use case

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*le0DWYlNDPLow8iCBglC3g.png)

[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com) and [Flowith](https://flowith.io) both support uploading multi-format files and external links. Flowith further analyzes and categorizes these materials, turning them into content seeds with associated keywords, making retrieval easier.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*xOmbBIu0s2iZoHYpLwuvng.png)

Most products surrender the entire knowledge base to the AI once it’s uploaded. Users can’t control which part is being used. Tools like [YouMind](https://youmind.com) and [Notion AI](https://www.notion.com/product/ai) take a different approach: users can manually specify source files via @mentions, and context chips make these references explicit.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*lCi_Ezjp4a86RN9U9mCRyQ.png)

> Use semantic organization and content extraction to maintain a coherent conversational environment. This keeps the dialogue focused while allowing key ideas to be captured and reused.

The challenge here is managing the vertical sprawl of long chat threads.

Instead of letting conversations stretch endlessly downward, the system should compress and surface meaning, helping users stay anchored in the current topic while carrying important information forward.

### Key feature

* **Semantic aggregator:** Automatically identifies thematic segments in long conversations and presents them in collapsible topic sections, expanding only what’s relevant.
* **Content notebook:** Allows users to extract AI outputs into an independent workspace for refinement, reducing the friction of scrolling, copying, and tracking.

### Use case

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*1XFM4r9M7UAMkGUwQjNIUg.png)

[Ask LukeW,](https://ask.lukew.com/chat) the assistant on [Luke Wroblewski](https://www.lukew.com)’s website, groups conversations into thematic clusters. Only the active theme is expanded, with others neatly folded away. This preserves spatial clarity and keeps users oriented.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*bKD9rPhZV0IKWwTTZhd8iA.png)

Flowith’s Composer allows users to select AI outputs and send them directly into a dedicated workspace. This bridges the gap between conversation and downstream work, turning chat into a productive workflow rather than a transient thread.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*y7BqigZ5dZoceMaw4fYrew.png)

> By accumulating and recalling memory across sessions, the system builds a continuous personalized context for interaction, allowing generated responses to better reflect the user’s experiences and preferences.

Memory must balance two goals: **personalization** and **user control.**

The system should remember a user’s preferences, routines, and domain knowledge, but must do so transparently, allowing the user to manage what is stored, recalled, or forgotten.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*yHgNVJ1LC5Ci3OebVFtg1w.png)

You can search and delete saved memories in ChatGPT

### Key feature

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*sqWyQvXeRPv17SSq2b9IhQ.png)

* **Memory visualization:** AI responses display the memory elements they rely on, helping users understand why personalization occurs.
* **Memory management:** Users can enable or disable memory in each conversation, and view, edit, or block specific stored items.

### Prototype

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*PCRckFTVbRIj9YLyV6Zc3w.png)

I designed a set of memory controls for ChatGPT to make personalization more visible and negotiable.

Whenever the system draws on a stored memory, it surfaces as a small memory chip in the interface. This makes the moment of personalization explicit rather than hidden in the background.

From there, users can choose to keep, edit, or remove the memory fragment. The goal is not to collect more data, but to let users actively shape how the system remembers them over time.

## Context is the king — but how?

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/1*h-I0xqq92qNHJcRUkvnsvA.png)

If context is king, its power comes from how carefully we design the layers that support it.

Library, conversation, and memory are not separate modules. They are three ways of structuring intelligence. They shape how knowledge is organized, how interaction happens, and how humans and AI come to understand each other over time.

Context is not just the background of interaction. It is the structure that allows meaning to emerge at all.

# [五条1222] Linear创始人：设计远不止是代码
发布日期：2025/12/21

[See all posts](https://baoyu.io/translations)

关于“用代码做设计”的争论由来已久，最近又吵翻天了。这已经是我第三次写这个话题了。我之前写过 [“设计是一种探索，而非流水线”](https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/1999730838280503775)；也讨论过 [“工具本身带有观点”](https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/2000451411696603437)，这些观点会潜移默化地塑造我们认为哪些尝试是“合理”的；我还谈到了为什么过早引入限制会扼杀尚未被发现的可能性。

坦白说，我对行业里这种追求“大一统”的趋势持怀疑态度——试图把一个充满细微差别的过程全部坍缩成代码，并称之为“进步”。

最近的讨论焦点主要集中在：设计师到底该不该写代码？代码是不是设计的正确媒介？代码是否呈现了设计的“真相”？等等。但我认为，把辩论的中心仅仅放在代码和工具上，是把路走窄了（Reductive）。

对我来说，更大的问题在于：在未来，尤其是当 AI 和新一代工具普及后，我们如何看待设计师的贡献？角色将如何演变？我们对彼此的期望又会有什么变化？

设计师现在算是工程师了吗？背负着同样的期望？工程师会开始对设计师有同样的要求吗？未来我们还会有“工程负责人”和“设计负责人”吗，还是会变成一个统一的“匠心负责人”（Head of Craft）？头衔本身并不重要，但这背后的问题很有价值，因为它们揭示了我们真正看重什么，以及我们要如何把工作做好。

这就引出了一个实际问题：如果设计师被推向工程领域，直接用代码进行设计，这真的是个好方向吗？我们会因此失去什么，又得到什么？

这场讨论之所以容易变得混乱，部分原因在于“设计”这个词对不同的人意味着完全不同的东西。你的看法取决于你从事哪种设计，以及你如何理解设计这项实践。

我相信设计有多种风味。它受个人、领域、市场和客户的影响。在消费级产品（C端）中，你可能需要快速测试想法，因为用户的动机很难预测；在企业级服务（B2B）中，你通常拥有更多的上下文背景，可以据此进行设计。有些行业需要极致的可靠性和清晰度。环境也很重要：利益相关者、客户、公司文化，以及你作为设计师的技能。如果你擅长视觉，你会以视觉为主导；如果你代码能力强，你可能会更早地使用代码。

而对另一些人来说，设计无非就是把按钮画到屏幕上，然后完事。

所以，软件设计是一个广阔的领域，里面包含了各种各样的工具和方法。“代码 vs 无代码”的争论往往搞错了重点，反而成了一种制造对立的力量。

我想表达的是，我想把这场讨论提升到工具之上，确保工具不会反客为主，接管设计的未来。我不希望我们仅仅因为新工具让“执行”变得更容易，就毫无必要地贬低“概念性思维”和“发散性思维”的价值。

即使是整天与代码打交道的工程师，也会时不时从代码中抽身出来。他们会画架构图、规划系统、推演权衡。虽然代码是软件栖息的地方，但它并不总是做出所有决策的最佳场所。

为了解释我的意思，我必须从我如何理解设计以及我如何实践设计开始说起。

首先，我不是科班出身的设计师。过去二十年里，我通过数百个设计项目自学成才。所以我不是在搞“看门人”那一套（Gatekeeping，指设立门槛排斥他人），也不是在鼓吹某种唯一的“正确”设计方式。但我确实认为，设计很少是线性的。你需要在不同的抽象层级上工作，并在它们之间来回切换。虽然结果是最终目标，但在过程中花费的时间往往能让结果变得更好。

通过这些工作，我学会了一件事：**首先质疑问题本身，而不是把它当作既定假设。** 如果有人让我做一个东西，我会先问：这是一个真问题吗？如果我们不做这个会怎样？是谁定义了这个问题？

这听起来有点哲学，但我发现，设计项目拖延或失败的最常见原因，就是问题本身没搞清楚。人们无法在解决方案上达成一致，是因为他们脑子里想解决的问题根本就不是同一个。于是，解决方案变成了针对许多不同问题的妥协产物，而不是针对一个核心问题的干净利落的解法。当利益相关者（Stakeholders）太多时，这种情况会更加恶化。

为了解决这个问题，我会做两件事。第一，按照我的理解把问题写下来，并询问谁是利益相关者。第二，当向这些利益相关者展示方案时，我会重申这个问题，看看是否会引起反应。如果有异议，我会停下来，先让全屋子的人在“问题”上达成一致。你可能会问，这跟设计有什么关系？这听起来很像公司管理那一套。

但你总是会有利益相关者的，如果不是同事，那就是客户。你必须搞清楚，收到的反馈是因为你的方案不够好，还是因为大家对“问题是什么”没达成共识。有时候，你是在为一个错误的问题做设计。“问题”是等式的第一部分，它是你设计和构建一切的基础。

在 Linear，我们很快就意识到公司需要“项目”（Projects）这个功能。路书上写着“构建项目功能”，每个人都同意这是必须的。但如果你再深想一层：为什么公司要通过“项目”来组织工作？为什么不直接做一个接一个的任务？如果他们没有“项目”会发生什么？

你可以深入研究项目管理。这背后有一整套学科，以及各种各样的方法论。但如果你的愿景是为软件公司构建一个专用工具，你就得开始做减法。他们真正关心的是什么？

简单来说，“项目”是公司管理工作流的一种自然**抽象** **（Abstraction，指在软件工程中将复杂系统简化为更易管理的概念）**。它们有助于权责分明、归属感、跨团队协作、可预测性和可见性。

现在你可能会问，为什么要研究这么基础或众所周知的东西？有时候你确实不需要。但了解整个版图和历史能给你定位。你会发现哪些假设是可以挑战的，或者决定遵循哪些传统。

最重要的是，先搞懂问题有助于你决定要怎么处理它。产品愿景把你拉向哪个方向？你想优化和影响什么？

在 Linear，我们要么不做，要做就发现“项目”可能是最重要的工作单位。产品是由项目组成的，组织是围绕项目运转的，当一个项目发布时，你们会庆祝。这种理解为我们试图解决的问题指明了方向。

我把设计解决方案的过程分为两个阶段：**概念阶段**（The conceptual stage）和 **执行阶段**（The execution stage）。

* **概念阶段** 是寻找设计将呈现的整体形态。
* **执行阶段** 是将其构建出来并呈现在屏幕上。

以问题追踪工具中的“项目”为例，你可以把它处理成一个带有子问题的大号问题（Issue），或者一个文件夹/标签，或者一个连接到问题的独立实体。这些都是你不需要在屏幕上画任何东西就可以思考的概念性想法。决策取决于你对用户、公司和你想要达到的愿景的理解。所有这些概念都行得通，你可以在现实产品中找到它们的影子。

因为我们认为“项目”很重要，且不同于“问题”，所以它们需要成为一个独立的实体，拥有自己的形状。一个项目应该有可识别的形式和功能，能够传达状态、理由、用户反馈、优先级、时间安排，以及与更大计划的联系。把“项目”降级为一个标签或一堆松散的问题集合，感觉是不对的。

这个概念阶段可以用文字、纸笔、设计工具或代码来完成。关键在于赋予这些想法一个形状，尝试不同的方向，最终选择那个最能服务于问题和产品愿景的方向。

一旦我有了一个我相信的方向，就准备好接受更广泛的反馈了。你会通过构建它来测试这个概念。

这是最接近最终产出的部分。你让设计概念真正跑起来，把它塑造成真实的东西。代码，或者说与“材料”直接打交道，在这一步至关重要。有些时候，你会获得新的洞察，不得不回过头去重新审视问题或概念。

在这个阶段使用代码有不同的方式。你可以构建工具，或者用“用完即弃的代码”（throwaway code）进行“草绘”。这消除了一些生产环境代码的限制，使过程更具探索性。我想说的是，虽然你可能认为执行阶段才是设计的“本体”，但其实你已经建立了一个包含上下文和信心的基础。当“材料”开始反击时（意指在编码过程中遇到现实的限制或困难），你是带着那份信心在推进的。

**我们可以用大语言模型（LLM）的逻辑来类比：**

你之前做的所有设计工作（理解问题、确定概念），就像是你为了让 **AI 智能体（AI Agent）** 解决问题而构建的 **目标（Goal）、上下文（Context）和提示词（Prompt）**。而执行工作，则是你在引导智能体做出一个个具体的决定。

读完这些，你可能会想：谁有时间搞这些？我们需要发布产品啊！为什么不直接开干，边做边想？我不认为这是时间问题。我的解释可能很长，但这个过程本身可以很快。你只是花了必要的时间而已。

我的感觉是，如果没有内置那些上下文和目标，你可能确实在朝着某个方向迭代，但那不是一个经过深思熟虑后选择的方向。

这让我回到了文章开头。我们的行业非常缺乏耐心，一旦你开始默认直接把设计构建到生产环境中，那些去思考问题、概念和意图的文化与组织理由就开始蒸发了。我们开始为了产出而贬低设计背后的“为什么”。

我担心的不是代码或工具本身。我担心的是深思熟虑（Consideration）的衰退，随之而来的是独特、设计精良的产品的衰退。问题在于，随着新工具和技术的出现，我们如何保持这份匠心？

对我来说，设计从来不是关于按钮长什么样或它是干嘛的，也不是关于你用什么媒介工作。它过去是，现在依然是——**找到正确的问题、正确的意图、正确的愿景。** 你今天设计和构建的功能，应该是通往那个愿景的、经过深思熟虑的一步。

**感谢 Charlie Aufmann, Tuhin Kumar, Ramon Marc, Conor Muirhead, Gavin Nelson, Raphael Schaad, Jeff Smith, 和 Soleio 对本话题的评论和讨论。**
